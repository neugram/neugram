## Neugram

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/neugram/ng.png)](http://travis-ci.org/neugram/ng)

Neugram is a scripting language and shell.

It is an early-stage experimental hobby project.
You can install from HEAD with:

```
go get -u neugram.io/ng
```

The language uses Go's syntax for expressions and follows its type system closely.
The intention is lightweight interaction with Go packages.

There is a bit of a [shell user guide](https://github.com/neugram/ng/blob/master/docs/shell.md).

For more information, see the [neugram website](https://neugram.io).
